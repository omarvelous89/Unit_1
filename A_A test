>You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.

Bathing suit sales are usually lower in the winter so this is a seasonal business. You can also test the two versions simultaneously by sending out the e-mails randomly to those on the mailing list.

>You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.

An example of selection bias. It's an observation that is to be expected given the setting.

>You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.

This could potentially be a few types of biases all relating to the fact that the initial time period is where the most impact is to be expected for an ad campaign but how long it sustains that impact is where effectiveness is judged. The person who made the billboard may exhibit a confirmation bias and only look the portion of the data that puts their project in a good light.

Also and example of Duration neglect.

> You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
An example of Duration neglect which is defined as "the neglect of the duration of an episode in determining it's value." The object here being a  loyalty program, requires more time to fairly evaluate it's effectiveness. The given period is not adequate.
